🌌 Astral Draw – The Cosmic NFT Lottery on Hedera

Astral Draw is a next-generation, blockchain-powered lottery platform built on Hedera Hashgraph, reimagining the traditional lottery experience through an immersive cosmic narrative and NFT-gated participation.

Players do not just buy lottery tickets – they forge Star Keys, enter Astral Convergences, and compete for a share of the Nebula Vault (prize pool).
Every draw is transparent, verifiable, and provably fair thanks to Hedera’s Verifiable Random Function (VRF) service.

🚀 Vision

The global lottery industry is worth over $300 billion, but is plagued by trust issues, lack of transparency, and static experiences.
Astral Draw fixes this by:

🌐 Leveraging Hedera’s speed & fairness – near-instant transactions, low gas fees.

🔒 NFT-based ticketing – every ticket is a verifiable digital asset.

🎲 On-chain randomness – powered by Hedera’s PRNG service, ensuring draws are fair.

🎮 Immersive gamification – players feel like they are on a cosmic quest, not just buying tickets.

💸 Global access – payments via crypto & fiat onramps, making it inclusive.

Astral Draw aims to become the most trusted, most exciting lottery platform globally — with a vision to reach $100B+ in lifetime payouts.

Numbers are stored on-chain for public verification.

Winner Selection

Smart contract automatically triggers payouts to winners’ wallets.

Transparency

Anyone can verify ticket minting, draw randomness, and payouts using Hedera explorer.
